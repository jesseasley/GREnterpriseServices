<span class="caption">Cost-Effective, Environmentally-Friendly Waste Reduction</span>
<br><br>
G.R. Enterprises Services offers custom designed waste destructors which use the principle of hyper oxygenated incineration to 
virtually eliminate visible emissions while reducing waste volume by an average of 99.3%, thereby extending the useful life of 
landfills and reducing overall waste disposal costs.  
<br><br>
The medical and petroleum industries have found specific utility in our systems, while others, like the poultry processing industry, 
benefit from our capability to design waste-to-energy systems, recovering heat which can be used directly or for the cogeneration of electricity.  
<br><br>
<span class="caption">From Waste to Energy </span>
<br><br>
From waste to energy is the process by which wastes are utilized as fuel to heat boiler pipes.  High temperatures produced by burning wastes 
turn water into steam that can then be used to turn turbine blades, which in turn drive an electrical generator.  The phrase "from waste 
to energy" is used alternatively with the term "source recovery".   "From waste to energy" looks more beneficial than burying wastes since 
it is a way to recycle wastes, and solids wastes are reduced in volume from 100 to 1.  This saves valuable landfill space and uses a 
renewable source of energy to supply electricity to homes.
<br><br>
<span class="caption">How it works</span>
<br><br>
The following list shows various models of incinerators offered by G.R. Enterprises Services. These units can be classed into two 
groups: air curtain "pit" burners ("ACD") and controlled-air afterburner types.  
<br><br>
G.R. Enterprises Services offers ACD units in five different sizes of above ground refractory lined pits equipped with an 
over-fire air system that creates a 130 mph curtain of air in a horizontal plane the length of the pit.  This creates a tornado reaction 
inside the refractory lined pit.  The burning material below the air curtain is resting on a hearth that is equipped with a 
special designed under-fire air system.  This system forces air up through the burning bed, much like a blacksmith's forge.  
The reaction of the over-fire air and the under-fire air system drives the temperature up to over 2200 deg. F and reduces the 
volume of combustible waste by 99.3% to a sterilized ash.  Since all smoke is burned at 1600 deg. F., this unit operates smokeless.

<span class="caption">Product Line</span>
<br><br>
Because some cities, counties, municipalities, industries, and institutions have special waste streams that are not permitted to be burned 
in an ACD, G.R. Enterprises offers controlled-air units that allow these facilities to burn their hard to dispose of material. To meet these 
requirements G.R. Enterprises Services offers 10 different sizes of controlled air or starved air combustors.  These units burn the waste then 
burn the smoke and particulate.  This is done by using three different chambers.  The first chamber is operated at 1500 deg. F. 
where the waste is burning, using very little oxygen.  As the waste burns, it turns into smoke, particulate and a 1500 deg. F gas 
of carbon monoxide.  This mixture leaves this primary combustion chamber and enters the air mixing chamber. Once the smoke, particulate and carbon monoxide enter 
the air mixing chamber, air is blown in tangentially to provide complete mixing of the gases.  The 1500 deg. F. carbon monoxide and oxygen 
combine in a controlled explosion and the temperature at the exit point of this chamber is 2000 deg.F.  The oxygen which has joined with 
the carbon monoxide has now turned to carbon dioxide and water vapor.  Once these gases leave the air mixing chamber, they enter the pollution control 
chamber. The pollution control chamber will hold these gases for one full second, which is time enough to allow the 1800 to 2000 deg. 
F. chamber to eliminate all smoke and unburned particulate.  Since all smoke is totally destroyed at 1600 deg. F., the emissions coming out 
of the stack has no smoke, odor or fly ash.

With high alternative fuel costs, payout of this equipment is often less than two years.
